# CHANGELOG

## 2026-11-07 — Bank feed: Plaid connection, Import Rules, review workflow, split panel, student loans kept separate
- What changed:
  - **Import Rules** tab: one row per bank-description pattern (Contains /
    Starts With / Exact, optionally per account) that fills Type, Category,
    Subcategory, Spending Type, Person, Fund/Debt on imported rows. Each rule
    can **Auto-import** (straight to Transactions) or require a **Split**.
    Rules are made from a staged row with *Make a rule from the selected
    row…* and are applied to waiting rows at once.
  - **Import Staging** gains Status, Suggested Type/Person/Fund/Debt, Matched
    Rule, Merchant (from bank), Bank Category, Pending Transaction ID, Paired
    Import ID and Imported At. The engine (`Import.gs`) classifies rows,
    pairs transfers between owned accounts (both sides Transfer) and card
    payments (bank side Debt Payment to the linked debt, card side Transfer),
    replaces a pending charge with its posted version, and soft-deletes a
    transaction the bank withdraws. *Import reviewed rows* turns ticked rows
    into transactions; rows missing a category are held with a reason.
  - **Split panel** (side panel, `SplitPanel.html`): splits a staged or
    recorded transaction into balanced children; Remaining must reach $0.00.
  - **Connections** tab + **Plaid** (`Plaid.gs`): Hosted Link connect flow
    (`ConnectDialog.html`, three steps: kind of account → sign in at Plaid →
    map accounts), access tokens in Script Properties, nightly
    `/transactions/sync` with cursors, balances for balance-only accounts,
    Repair (update mode, never a new slot), layout check that pauses the
    sync instead of mis-writing, Status that never shows secrets.
  - **Accounts** gains External Account ID, Connection ID, Import
    Transactions?, Last Synced. Real accounts are preset: transactions for
    PayPal, Independent Bank ×3, Capital One; balance-only for Acorns,
    Fidelity, HSA.
  - **Debts** gains Debt Group (Household / Student Loans); the KPI band shows
    Household Debt, Student Loans and All Debt. Quarterly Debt Review gains a
    calculated Debt Group. Monthly Summary's *Reviewed Debt Balance* is
    renamed **Reviewed Household Debt** (excludes student loans) and a
    **Student Loan Balance** column is added; Monthly Review's *Total Debt
    Balance* is renamed **Household Debt Balance** with a Student Loan
    Balance column added. Net worth still counts all debt. Debt Types gains
    **Tax Debt**.
  - **Upgrade workbook (keeps data)** (`Upgrade.gs`): adds missing tabs,
    columns (appended), lists and renamed headers to a live workbook, refreshes
    formulas/validations/formatting and the documentation tabs, preserves
    settings and the Dashboard month, and stops before changing anything if a
    header was renamed by hand.
  - **Copy financial snapshot for AI…** (`Export.gs`, `ExportDialog.html`):
    a plain-text briefing — income by month and person, monthly cash flow,
    spending by category and type, this month's plan and budget, every fund,
    every debt (household and student loans separate, APR, minimums,
    estimated interest), accounts and tracked net worth, recurring
    obligations, latest credit scores, recent review notes, data-quality
    notes — computed from entered columns only, with a Copy button. For
    pasting into a Claude project.
  - Dashboard: awaiting-review count (top right) and household/student-loan
    footnote. App Setup: setting *auto-import detected transfers and card
    payments*. Menu reorganized with a **Bank feed** submenu.
- Files to paste into Apps Script: changed — `Config.gs` (as Code.gs),
  `Helpers.gs` (reading a table no longer creates a missing tab),
  `Reference.gs`, `Tables.gs`, `Dashboard.gs`, `SampleData.gs`, `QA.gs`,
  `Main.gs`, `Api.gs`; new — `Import.gs`, `Plaid.gs`, `Upgrade.gs`,
  `Export.gs`, `SplitPanel.html`, `RuleDialog.html`, `ConnectDialog.html`,
  `ExportDialog.html`. Then run `upgradeWorkbook` once (it takes a lock, so
  a second copy started early simply says to wait).
- Sheet changes needed: none by hand (the upgrade adds them). Script
  Properties to add by hand: `PLAID_CLIENT_ID`, `PLAID_SECRET`; then Bank
  feed → Set history start date, Connect a bank (×9), Turn nightly sync on.
- Tested: Node (`tests/run-tests.js`, mocked Sheets + mocked Plaid): rule
  matching and scoping, classification, transfer and card-payment pairing,
  review import with held-back rows, rule-from-dialog auto-import, split
  panel, Hosted Link connect → exchange → mapping → first sync (two pages,
  start-date filter, balances, cursor), pending→posted supersede, bank
  removal → soft delete, idempotent re-sync, layout-check pause, trigger
  on/off, status without secrets, repair in update mode, upgrade of an
  older workbook (tabs, columns, renames, lists, data preserved, idempotent,
  conflict stop). Not yet run in Google: everything above; Plaid Hosted Link
  against the real API; the HTML dialogs.

## 2026-11-07 — First build: the whole workbook from one Apps Script project
- What changed: a from-scratch rebuild of the Household Finance Tracker as a
  versioned Apps Script. `buildWorkbookWithSample` creates all 20 tabs in the
  handoff's phase order (reference tables → raw ledgers → import
  infrastructure → derived reporting → Dashboard → QA) with formulas,
  dropdowns, conditional formatting, named ranges, tagged sample data and a
  Finance Tracker menu. Fixes the three defects from the handoff (Dashboard
  Federal Tax rows and payroll headers; Monthly Budget soft-delete filter;
  Source Income ID validation plus an auto-link helper) and normalizes the
  Child Expenses taxonomy. Adds a split-transaction helper, Change Log
  capture on edit, a net-worth snapshot helper, in-sheet QA and a web-app
  scaffold. Details in `docs/BUILD_NOTES.md`.
- Files to paste into Apps Script (a brand-new blank Sheet): all nine files
  in `apps-script/` — `Config.gs`, `Helpers.gs`, `Reference.gs`, `Tables.gs`,
  `Dashboard.gs`, `SampleData.gs`, `QA.gs`, `Main.gs`, `Api.gs` — each as a
  Script file of the same name. Then run `buildWorkbookWithSample` once.
- Sheet changes needed (tabs, headers, settings): none by hand; the script
  creates everything. Do not run the build on a Sheet that holds real data.
- Tested: Node tests (`tests/run-tests.js`) pass. Confirmed in Google on
  2026-11-07: `runQA()` all PASS.
- Conversation: https://claude.ai/code/session_01XRPeQZr4LZj8gNZ59qZQ2V
- Branch: `main` (initial commit), then `claude/split-files-and-handoff`
  (repository layout to match the school-tools process; handoff page).
